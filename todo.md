# To-do list
- Bind functions from RGFW (alternative back-end/window library) and have an option to use it
- Bind gamepad functions from GLFW
  - I have bindings for alpha letters, shift, enter and escape.
  - I should learn layout next.
  - After learning layout, I should design and implement symbols
- Modify deletion functions to use `PersistentVector.delete` 
- Implement 'yj' motion and add tests for it
