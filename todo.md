# To-do list
- Bind functions from RGFW (alternative back-end/window library) and have an option to use it
  - Added most callbacks, including char callbacks, but I need to change the C side of the char callbacks so that symbols like [ become shifted properly.
- Bind gamepad functions from GLFW
- Implement 'yj' motion and add tests for it
