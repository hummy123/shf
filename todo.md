# To-do list

- Add tests for:
- Reimplement `d%` motion.
  - It should both search for the next character in any pair, the same way in Vim
  - Add tests for reimplemented movements and motions
- Reimplement `di<symbol>` and `da<symbol>`
  - They should search for the next char in the specific pair, the same way in Vim
  - Add tests for both

  Afterwards, add tests for yanking.

  Add yank commands like yh/yj/yk/yl as well and test them too.
