# To-do list
- Bind functions from RGFW (alternative back-end/window library) and have an option to use it
  - Add callbacks so we can react to events. (Start by adding key callbacks.)
- Bind gamepad functions from GLFW
- Modify deletion functions to use `PersistentVector.delete` 
- Implement 'yj' motion and add tests for it
